Visual Appearance:

	Every single frontend file should use the same css and aesthetic javascript
	found in the assests. If a seperate css modification needs to be made, create
	a master css page (created: rsvp.css) and add it to the css files. 

	This is to ensure visual consistency across all web pages.
	
	Everyone should include the navbar found in navbar.html on their pages.
